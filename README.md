## Features

- Fast .d.ts generation via isolatedDeclaration
- Configurability
- Cross-platform binary
- Bun-powered

## Install

```bash
bun install -d dts-generation
```

<!-- _Alternatively, you can install:_

```bash
brew install dts-generation # wip
pkgx install dts-generation # wip
``` -->

## Get Started

There are two ways of using this dts generation tool: _as a library or as a CLI._

### Library

Given the npm package is installed:

```js
import { generate } from 'dts-generation'

generate()
```

### CLI

```bash
dts-generation ...
dts-generation --help
dts-generation --version
```

## Configuration

The Reverse Proxy can be configured using a `dts.config.ts` _(or `dts.config.js`)_ file and it will be automatically loaded when running the `dts-generation` command.

```ts
// dts.config.ts (or dts.config.js)
export default {
  cwd: './',
  root: './src',
  outdir: './dist',
  keepComments: true,
}
```

_Then run:_

```bash
dts-generation generate
```
